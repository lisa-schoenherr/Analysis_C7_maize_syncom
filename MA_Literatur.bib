abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The exchange of metabolites (i.e., metabolic interactions) between bacteria in the rhizosphere determines various plant-associated functions. Systematically understanding the metabolic interactions in the rhizosphere, as well as in other types of microbial communities, would open the door to the optimization of specific predefined functions of interest, and therefore to the harnessing of the functionality of various types of microbiomes. However, mechanistic knowledge regarding the gathering and interpretation of these interactions is limited. Here, we present a framework utilizing genomics and constraint-based modeling approaches, aiming to interpret the hierarchical trophic interactions in the soil environment. 243 genome scale metabolic models of bacteria associated with a specific disease-suppressive vs disease-conducive apple rhizospheres were drafted based on genome-resolved metagenomes, comprising an in silico native microbial community. Iteratively simulating microbial community members' growth in a metabolomics-based apple root-like environment produced novel data on potential trophic successions, used to form a network of communal trophic dependencies. Network-based analyses have characterized interactions associated with beneficial vs non-beneficial microbiome functioning, pinpointing specific compounds and microbial species as potential disease supporting and suppressing agents. This framework provides a means for capturing trophic interactions and formulating a range of testable hypotheses regarding the metabolic capabilities of microbial communities within their natural environment. Essentially, it can be applied to different environments and biological landscapes, elucidating the conditions for the targeted manipulation of various microbiomes, and the execution of countless predefined functions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Stoichiometric metabolic modeling, particularly genome-scale models (GSMs), is now an indispensable tool for systems biology. The model reconstruction process typically involves collecting information from public databases; however, incomplete systems knowledge leaves gaps in any reconstruction. Current tools for addressing gaps use databases of biochemical functionalities to address gaps on a per-metabolite basis and can provide multiple solutions but cannot avoid thermodynamically infeasible cycles (TICs), invariably requiring lengthy manual curation. To address these limitations, this work introduces an optimization-based multi-step method named OptFill, which performs TIC-avoiding whole-model gapfilling. We applied OptFill to three fictional prokaryotic models of increasing sizes and to a published GSM of Escherichia coli, iJR904. This application resulted in holistic and infeasible cycle-free gapfilling solutions. In addition, OptFill can be adapted to automate inherent TICs identification in any GSM. Overall, OptFill can address critical issues in automated development of high-quality GSMs. Metabolic Engineering; Bioinformatics; Systems Biology; Metabolic Flux Analysis},

@article{Schafer2023a,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Microbiome composition is tied to host health and ecosystem function. However, the processes that determine species abundances in an environmental context remain poorly understood. Given that microbiomes are bounded by resource availability, insights into the metabolic capacities of their constituent organisms present a key avenue for predicting interspecies interactions and broader microbiome assembly rules. Plants constitute the largest biomass on Earth and are colonized by a variety of microorganisms that affect their health and growth. The composition of plant microbiomes has been found to be largely deterministic, suggesting the presence of defined drivers of community assembly. However, the metabolic mechanisms of the interactions underlying these patterns remain poorly understood. RATIONALE: To assess the degree to which patterns of resource allocation contribute to microbial interactions, we first profiled the carbon source–utilization capabilities of 224 representative bacterial strains isolated from leaves of wild Arabidopsis thaliana plants. To do this, we cultivated each isolate on 45 different carbon sources and developed a computational tool to score the growth of each strain in an automated way. This screen allowed us to calculate the degree of metabolic niche overlap between the strains, which informed predictions of resource competition on the plant host. We further leveraged this experimental data to generate a collection of 224 genome-scale metabolic models, which encompass the metabolic networks of each organism. We used these models to predict the outcomes of interspecies interactions on the plant host and to obtain mechanistic insight into specific patterns of resource use and exchange between these bacteria. RESULTS: We found that the carbon source– utilization profiles of the strains exhibited a strong phylogenetic signature, on the basis of both the experimental screen and the pathways represented in the genome-scale models. We validated the performance of the models and of predictions based on niche overlap by conducting competition experiments with two sets of strains on the Arabidopsis host. These experiments revealed a dominance of negative interaction outcomes (i.e., a strain reached a lower overall population level upon cocolonization compared with monoassociation), which was in agreement with predictions of high interstrain niche overlap. The genome-scale models provided an additional degree of insight into these interactions, also correctly predicting instances of positive outcomes observed in planta and further underscoring the importance of carbon metabolism to community assembly. After this experimental validation, we modeled interaction outcomes for more than 17,500 pairs of strains. We predicted that in 94{\%} of pairings, at least one strain would experience a reduction in abundance compared with monoassociation. We then analyzed the metabolic fluxes underlying these predicted outcomes, which revealed a high prevalence of competition for sugars. This competition could be offset by increased uptake of amino and organic acids in our simulations, which points to the metabolic mechanisms underpinning the positive interaction outcomes that we observed in planta. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate a major role for carbon source availability and metabolic interactions in community assembly in the plant host, which, together with the trait conservation observed here, likely contribute to the overall deterministic outcomes of plant microbiome assembly. In addition to recapitulating interspecies interactions in situ, our modeling framework represents a powerful tool for determining the metabolic mechanisms that lead to the emergence of specific ecological patterns. This knowledge will ultimately enable targeted microbiome design, which is pivotal to microbiome applications in health, agriculture, and the environment.},

abstract = {Development of an interface tool between the Biochemical, Genetic and Genomic (BiGG) and KEGG databases is necessary for simultaneous access to the features of both databases. For this purpose, we present the BiKEGG toolbox, an open source COBRA toolbox extension providing a set of functions to infer the reaction correspondences between the KEGG reaction identifiers and those in the BiGG knowledgebase using a combination of manual verification and computational methods. Inferred reaction correspondences using this approach are supported by evidence from the literature, which provides a higher number of reconciled reactions between these two databases compared to the MetaNetX and MetRxn databases. This set of equivalent reactions is then used to automatically superimpose the predicted fluxes using COBRA methods on classical KEGG pathway maps or to create a customized metabolic map based on the KEGG global metabolic pathway, and to find the corresponding reactions in BiGG based on the genome annotation of an organism in the KEGG database. Customized metabolic maps can be created for a set of pathways of interest, for the whole KEGG global map or exclusively for all pathways for which there exists at least one flux carrying reaction. This flexibility in visualization enables BiKEGG to indicate reaction directionality as well as to visualize the reaction fluxes for different static or dynamic conditions in an animated manner. BiKEGG allows the user to export (1) the output visualized metabolic maps to various standard image formats or save them as a video or animated GIF file, and (2) the equivalent reactions for an organism as an Excel spreadsheet.},

abstract = {Microorganisms rarely live isolated in their natural environments but rather function in consolidated and socializing communities. Despite the growing availability of high-throughput sequencing and metagenomic data, we still know very little about the metabolic contributions of individual microbial players within an ecological niche and the extent and directionality of interactions among them. This calls for development of efficient modeling frameworks to shed light on less understood aspects of metabolism in microbial communities. Here, we introduce OptCom, a comprehensive flux balance analysis framework for microbial communities, which relies on a multi-level and multi-objective optimization formulation to properly describe trade-offs between individual vs. community level fitness criteria. In contrast to earlier approaches that rely on a single objective function, here, we consider species-level fitness criteria for the inner problems while relying on community-level objective maximization for the outer problem. OptCom is general enough to capture any type of interactions (positive, negative or combinations thereof) and is capable of accommodating any number of microbial species (or guilds) involved. We applied OptCom to quantify the syntrophic association in a well-characterized two-species microbial system, assess the level of sub-optimal growth in phototrophic microbial mats, and elucidate the extent and direction of inter-species metabolite and electron transfer in a model microbial community. We also used OptCom to examine addition of a new member to an existing community. Our study demonstrates the importance of trade-offs between species- and community-level fitness driving forces and lays the foundation for metabolic-driven analysis of various types of interactions in multi-species microbial systems using genome-scale metabolic models. {\textcopyright} 2012 Zomorrodi, Maranas.},

Yet, the application of genome-scale models, especially to microbial communities, is lagging behind the availability of sequenced genomes. This is largely due to the time-consuming steps of manual curation required to obtain good quality models. Here, we present an automated tool, CarveMe, for reconstruction of species and community level metabolic models. We introduce the concept of a universal model, which is manually curated and simulation ready. Starting with this universal model and annotated genome sequences, CarveMe uses a topdown approach to build single-species and community models in a fast and scalable manner. We show that CarveMe models perform closely to manually curated models in reproducing experimental phenotypes (substrate utilization and gene essentiality). Additionally, we build a collection of 74 models for human gut bacteria and test their ability to reproduce growth on a set of experimentally defined media. Finally, we create a database of 5587 bacterial models and demonstrate its potential for fast generation of microbial community models. Overall, CarveMe provides an open-source and user-friendly tool towards broadening the use of metabolic modeling in studying microbial species and communities.},

Specifically, iJN1462 (i) incorporates several hundred additional genes and associated reactions resulting in new predictive capabilities, including new nutrients supporting growth; (ii) was validated by in vivo growth screens that included previously untested carbon (48) and nitrogen (41) sources; (iii) yielded gene essentiality predictions showing large accuracy when compared with a knockout library and Bar-seq data; and (iv) allowed mapping of its network to 82 P. putida sequenced strains revealing functional core that reflect the large metabolic versatility of this species, including aromatic compounds derived from lignin. Thus, this study provides a thoroughly updated metabolic reconstruction and new computable phenotypes for P. putida, which can be leveraged as a first step toward understanding the pan metabolic capabilities of Pseudomonas.},

abstract = {The initial genome-scale reconstruction of the metabolic network of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 was assembled in 2000. It has been updated and periodically released since then based on new and curated genomic and biochemical knowledge. An update has now been built, named iJO1366, which accounts for 1366 genes, 2251 metabolic reactions, and 1136 unique metabolites. iJO1366 was (1) updated in part using a new experimental screen of 1075 gene knockout strains, illuminating cases where alternative pathways and isozymes are yet to be discovered, (2) compared with its predecessor and to experimental data sets to confirm that it continues to make accurate phenotypic predictions of growth on different substrates and for gene knockout strains, and (3) mapped to the genomes of all available sequenced E. coli strains, including pathogens, leading to the identification of hundreds of unannotated genes in these organisms. Like its predecessors, the iJO1366 reconstruction is expected to be widely deployed for studying the systems biology of E. coli and for metabolic engineering applications.},

@article{Lachance2019,
abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) are mathematically structured knowledge bases of metabolism that provide phenotypic predictions from genomic information. GEM-guided predictions of growth phenotypes rely on the accurate definition of a biomass objective function (BOF) that is designed to include key cellular biomass components such as the major macromolecules (DNA, RNA, proteins), lipids, coenzymes, inorganic ions and species-specific components. Despite its importance, no standardized computational platform is currently available to generate species-specific biomass objective functions in a data-driven, unbiased fashion. To fill this gap in the metabolic modeling software ecosystem, we implemented BOFdat, a Python package for the definition of a Biomass Objective Function from experimental data. BOFdat has a modular implementation that divides the BOF definition process into three independent modules defined here as steps: 1) the coefficients for major macromolecules are calculated, 2) coenzymes and inorganic ions are identified and their stoichiometric coefficients estimated, 3) the remaining species-specific metabolic biomass precursors are algorithmically extracted in an unbiased way from experimental data. We used BOFdat to reconstruct the BOF of the Escherichia coli model iML1515, a gold standard in the field. The BOF generated by BOFdat resulted in the most concordant biomass composition, growth rate, and gene essentiality prediction accuracy when compared to other methods. Installation instructions for BOFdat are available in the documentation and the source code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/jclachance/BOFdat).},

@article{Carvalhais2011,
abstract = {Root exudates play a major role in the mobilization of sparingly soluble nutrients in the rhizosphere. Since the amount and composition of major metabolites in root exudates from one plant species have not yet been systematically compared under different nutrient deficiencies, relations between exudation patterns and the type of nutrient being deficient remain poorly understood. Comparing root exudates from axenically grown maize plants exposed to N, K, P, or Fe deficiency showed a higher release of glutamate, glucose, ribitol, and citrate from Fe‐deficient plants, while P deficiency stimulated the release of $\gamma$‐aminobutyric acid and carbohydrates. Potassium‐starved plants released less sugars, in particular glycerol, ribitol, fructose, and maltose, while under N deficiency lower amounts of amino acids were found in root exudates. Principal‐component analysis revealed a clear separation in the variation of the root‐exudate composition between Fe or P deficiency versus N or K deficiency in the first principal component, which explained 46{\%} of the variation in the data. In addition, a negative correlation was found between the amounts of sugars, organic and amino acids released under deficiency of a certain nutrient and the diffusion coefficient of the respective nutrient in soils. We thus hypothesize that the release of dominant root exudates such as sugars, amino acids, and organic acids by roots may reflect an ancient strategy to cope with limiting nutrient supply.},

abstract = {The bacterial communities that live within the human gut have been linked to health and disease. However, we are still just beginning to understand how those bacteria interact and what potential interventions to our gut microbiome can make us healthier. Here, we present a mathematical modeling framework (named MICOM) that can recapitulate the growth rates of diverse bacterial species in the gut and can simulate metabolic interactions within microbial communities. We show that MICOM can unravel the ecological rules that shape the microbial landscape in our gut and that a given dietary or probiotic intervention can have widely different effects in different people. Compositional changes in the gut microbiota have been associated with a variety of medical conditions such as obesity, Crohn's disease, and diabetes. However, connecting microbial community composition to ecosystem function remains a challenge. Here, we introduce MICOM, a customizable metabolic model of the human gut microbiome. By using a heuristic optimization approach based on L2 regularization, we were able to obtain a unique set of realistic growth rates that corresponded well with observed replication rates. We integrated adjustable dietary and taxon abundance constraints to generate personalized metabolic models for individual metagenomic samples. We applied MICOM to a balanced cohort of metagenomes from 186 people, including a metabolically healthy population and individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Model results showed that individual bacterial genera maintained conserved niche structures across humans, while the community-level production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was heterogeneous and highly individual specific. Model output revealed complex cross-feeding interactions that would be difficult to measure in vivo . Metabolic interaction networks differed somewhat consistently between healthy and diabetic subjects. In particular, MICOM predicted reduced butyrate and propionate production in a diabetic cohort, with restoration of SCFA production profiles found in healthy subjects following metformin treatment. Overall, we found that changes in diet or taxon abundances have highly personalized effects. We believe MICOM can serve as a useful tool for generating mechanistic hypotheses for how diet and microbiome composition influence community function. All methods are implemented in an open-source Python package, which is available at https://github.com/micom-dev/micom .

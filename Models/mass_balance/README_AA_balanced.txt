The models from before_mass_balance underwent Frowins Script, i.e.
(1) Identify imbalanced reactions
(2) apply mass balance function
--> 2x Jupyter Notebook

there were in total 4 reactions were stoichiometry was not balanced
(see imbalanced_reactions.csv)

after fixing these reactions, we now have the 7 balanced models.

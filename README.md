# Lisa's Code Repository

This repository contains all of Lisa's work on her master thesis project about Analysing Plant-Microbe Interactions via community modelling of metabolic interactions in the C7 Maize root SynCom.

My code is written in Jupyter Notebooks, see \
(1) create_metabolic_models.ipynb \
(2) balance_metabolic_models.ipynb (this will focus more on charge balancing) \
(3,4) Frowins Scripts for mass balancing \
The Notebooks are all mostly work in progress at the moment. 

Additionally, the other folders contain: \
(1) Datatsets, i.e. the protein fasta files (.faa) for every of the seven bacterial species that o work with and that are used to create the metabolic model with carveme \
(2) Models, i.e. metabolic models as .xml files \
(3) Reports, i.e. memote reports to check model quality

For every model or rather every step of the progress of curating my models, MEMOTE reports were made. This can be found in the folders.
The report folders are named in the same way like the model folders to show their correspondence. 

Additionally, MACAW was used two times: first to get results that were used for automated and manual curation of mostly duplicates and a second time after the de-duplication step was finished.

    "I use the BIGG database to compare the info there with model info and automatically replace charge and formula of metabolites with BIGG info if it seems more reasonable.\n",
    "After this automated step, the remaining unbalanced reactions need to be manually curated.\n",
    "For a few reactions it is also possible to compare them to the reaction used in other very well curated models (here I used the e.coli iml1515 model) to check how they balanced the reaction."

However 30% of our metabolites in each model do not have an inchikey annotation. We tried to fetch them automated from PubChem. Unfortunately there is no way to be sure that the correct inchikey was fetched from the DB and with stricter limitations (e.g. only get inchikey if name and formula match between Pubchem and Model or only use inchikey if there was exactly one result) the amount of inchikeys that we get is not very useful."

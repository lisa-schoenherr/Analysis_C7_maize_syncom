    "In order to compute the high performance area for a starting point a technique involving random sampling was devised in order to map out this area. Firstly, flux balance analysis (FVA) was used to estimate the range of possible nitrogen and light uptake values, with the FVA constrained to have at least a sum of fluxes equal to the absolute sum of fluxes of the starting point. This will save us a lot of computation time, by defining a priori the bounds in which random values for nitrogen and light uptake should be generated.\n",

    "Then, a new pFBA simulation will be performed with the constrains that the biomass value must be at least 80% of the one obtained with the initial pFBA simulation for the starting point, and the sum of fluxes value cannot surpass the one determined for the starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "By defining the high performance areas as the range of feasible solutions for the model under the aforementioned constrains for different light and nitrogen uptakes, one of the most logical courses of action in order to map them out would be to perform a lot of simulations with different light and nitrogen uptakes, and store feasible solutions. That is exactly what the code described below performs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function will receive the feasible range of uptakes of nitrogen and light from the FVA and use them in functions from the random module of python, which will generate random numbers within those constrains. These values will then be used as a forced flux value for the nitrogen and light uptakes of the simulation. Unfeasible solutions will be ignored, and the algorithm will stop once 500 feasible solutions have been reached."
